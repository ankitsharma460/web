<p><font color="yellow" size ="5">SAARTHI Organises Organ Donation Camps.. Organ donation is a social act and it can be done by a living donor or a person who is brain dead. A few of the common organ transplantations include the Liver, intestines, kidneys, heart, and bone marrow. Organs are mostly donated after the death of the owner, however, many people are unaware of the noble act.Organ donation is a legal process through which the healthy organs and the tissues of one person are transplanted to another person. The person who donates his or her organs is known as a donor and the person who receives the organs is known as the organ receiver. Organ donation takes place by the consent of the donor when he or she was alive or by the consent of the family members of the donors. Organ donation is a noble act that can save millions of lives and sadly many people don't know the impact it has on other people’s lives. Even after death, a donor could bring joy to the life of the receiver.</font color></p>

<p><font color="yellow" size ="5">Eye donation is an act of donating one's eyes after his/her death. It is an act of charity, purely for the benefit of the society and is totally voluntary. The eye donation of the deceased can be authorized by the next of kith & kin even if the deceased did not pledge to donate her eyes before deathAge or systemic illness such as diabetes or hypertension, heart disease, kidney disease is not barriers for eye donations. The corneas of a person are unaffected even if they have undergone any eye surgeries in the past and hence will be useful can be transplanted in others.There are wide spread social awareness programs and activities conducted across the country to impart the significance of eye donation and its usefulness to the visually impaired people. Till date, medical researchers and scientists are working on developing artificial cornea, but till that time, donating the eyes would be the best gift ever for a blind person suffering from corneal.</font color></p>

<p align="center"><img src="abc8..jpg" height="500px" width="50%">
<p><font color="yellow" size ="5">The word has witnessed tremendous development in the field of social work in the last three decades. As a result, development of social welfare programs throughout the global has been on the rise to address social and human problems. After the Second World War that resulted in the expansion of governments’ efforts to decolonization movements across the globe and which saw new nations emerging in Asia and Africa. This war ended in 1945, and postwar recovery measures were put in place namely; implementation of wartime proposal for state expansion that saw the rise of size and scope of social welfare reforms in Western Europe. In addition, these programs were replicated across the globe by 1970s.However; by early 1980s sustaining these programs became an issue and new ideas like neoliberalism started to emerge.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Welfare refers to government-sponsored assistance programs for individuals and families in need.</li>
<li>Welfare programs are typically funded through taxation.</li>
<li>In the U.S., the federal government provides grants to each state through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program.</li>
<li>Welfare beneficiaries usually receive biweekly or monthly payments in the form of food stamps, vouchers, or even direct payments.</li>

<h1 <p align="center"> <font color="blue" size="7"> <u>Rights & Entitlements Programs</u></font color></h1>
<p align="center"><img src="abc9..jpg" height="500px" width="50%">
<p><font color="yellow" size ="5">Historically, India has provided only limited welfare.  It can certainly afford to provide more as it grows richer. Yet fiscal crises in the West warn us that entitlements can grow so rapidly as to threaten even rich governments with bankruptcy.  Because of budget constraints, entitlements must be limited. But rights should not be limited. So, don’t confuse rights with entitlements. US economists calculate that three welfare measures — social security (for the aged), Medicare (for the aged) and Medicaid (for the poor)—will triple from 7% of GDP to 20% in the next decade, swallowing up virtually all federal tax revenue. Jagadeesh Gokhale of the Cato Institute calculates that, including social security, the US is headed for a national debt that’s 500% of GDP, and Europe of 434%. Laurence Kotlikoff of Boston University says welfare measures have become a Ponzi scheme, which work by constantly shifting burdens to future generations.</p>
<h5> Tax laws are relaxed for the them to ease their financial burden :</h5>
<ol type="1">
<li> Tax law is the practice of law that relates to the assessment and payment of taxes.</li>
<li>Few of such taxes include inheritance tax,[5] interest tax, gift tax, wealth tax, etc. Wealth Tax Act, 1957 was repealed in the year 2015.</li>
